# Created by use_targets().
# Follow the comments below to fill in this target script.
# Then follow the manual to check and run the pipeline:
#   https://books.ropensci.org/targets/walkthrough.html#inspect-the-pipeline

# Load packages required to define the pipeline:
library(targets)
library(tarchetypes)
# library(clustermq)

# Set target options:
tar_option_set(
  packages = c("tidyverse"),
  memory = "transient",
  garbage_collection = TRUE,
  seed = 1
)

# Run the R scripts with custom functions:
tar_source(files = c(
  "R/",
  "1_site_selection_workflow.R",
  "2_variable_selection_workflow.R",
  "3_model_evaluation_workflow.R"))

# Replace the target list below with your own:
config_targets <- list(
  tar_target(
    name = data,
    command = tibble(x = rnorm(100), y = rnorm(100))
    # format = "qs" # Efficient storage for general data objects.
  ),
  tar_target(
    name = model,
    command = coefficients(lm(y ~ x, data = data))
  )
)

# Full targets list
c(config_targets,
  site_selection_targets_list)
